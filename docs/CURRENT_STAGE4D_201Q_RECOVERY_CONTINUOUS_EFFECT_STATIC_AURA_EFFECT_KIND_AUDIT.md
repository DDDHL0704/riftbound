# Stage 4D-201Q Recovery Continuous Effect Static Aura Effect Kind Audit

Date: 2026-06-09

Owner: A_MAIN

## Scope

Stage 4D-201Q adds one server-test shard for spectator recovery replay timing continuous-effect static-aura missing `effectKind` validation when the spectator continuous effect count still matches authoritative state and aggregate same-count comparisons remain active.

Runtime changed: no. Test coverage only.

Files changed:

- `tests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests/MatchRecoveryTests.cs`

## Coverage

New test:

- `RecoveryValidatorRejectsSpectatorReplayTimingContinuousEffectKeyedStaticAuraEffectKindMissingFieldWithoutCountMismatch`

The test builds an authoritative battlefield static-aura continuous effect keyed as `STATIC_AURA:BATTLEFIELD_ALL_UNITS_POWER_PLUS_ONE:battlefield-1:participant-1`. It starts from the redacted spectator replay frame, keeps the single spectator continuous effect keyed to authoritative state, removes only the static-aura `effectKind` field, and leaves the spectator continuous effect count equal to authoritative count.

Missing field covered:

- `effectKind`

Assertions prove recovery validation emits:

- Static-aura effect-kind required diagnostics.
- Keyed authoritative `effectKind` mismatch diagnostics for the static-aura effect id.
- Aggregate continuous-effect kind disagreement diagnostics while counts still match.

Assertions also prove this same-count path does not emit a continuous-effect count mismatch diagnostic.

## Validation

Passed:

- Focused: `/Users/dinghaolin/.dotnet/dotnet test tests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RecoveryValidatorRejectsSpectatorReplayTimingContinuousEffectKeyedStaticAuraEffectKindMissingFieldWithoutCountMismatch"` -> `1/1`.
- Changed class: `/Users/dinghaolin/.dotnet/dotnet test tests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MatchRecoveryTests"` -> `1541/1541`.
- Adjacent recovery: `/Users/dinghaolin/.dotnet/dotnet test tests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests/Riftbound.ConformanceTests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Recovery"` -> `1546/1546`.
- Backend full: `/Users/dinghaolin/.dotnet/dotnet test Riftbound.slnx` -> `7816/7816`.
- Mechanical: `git diff --check` passed.
- Mechanical: `rg -n "^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)" docs tests src` returned no conflict markers.
